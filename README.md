This project provides a 6-month performance analysis of a Coffee Shop business using sales data across multiple store locations and different times of day.
The goal is to identify key revenue drivers, sales patterns, and opportunities for business improvement.
Key Insights
1. Revenue Trends (Feb → June)


Revenue across all store locations increased by 50% in June compared to February.


This demonstrates a strong upward performance trend and improved customer demand over time.


2. Product Revenue Contribution


Coffee contributes 38% of total revenue within the 6-month period.


Tea contributes 28%, making it the second highest revenue-generating product.


These two categories are the major sales drivers for the business.


3. Units Sold by Time of Day

54% of total sales occur in the morning across all stores.


Only 15% of sales happen in the evening, while


Night sales account for just 0.4%, indicating extremely low customer activity at night.


4. Revenue by Store Location & Time of Day


Morning remains the strongest revenue period across all store locations.


Revenue is consistently stable between 12 PM and 7 PM across the shops.


Introducing price-drop promotions around 10 AM may dilute customer value, as sales are already strong during morning peak hours.

 Recommendations

Consider expanding coffee and tea offerings since they contribute the largest share of revenue.
